# ahoCorasick_Scala
*an aho-corasick string pattern matching algorithm implemented in Scala*

## Introduction 
Aho-Corasick Algorithm has been one of the most popular, widely-used sting pattern mathcing algorithm since its first publication in the paper, "Efficient String Mathcing: An Aid to Bibliographic Search." C, C++, or Java implementation of this algorithm can be easily found on the internet. However, it is hard to find Scala version that is easy to use and strictly based on the original paper in which the algorithm was first and formally presented. Hence, I hope many Scala users can take advantage of my implementation, saving huge amount of time reading papers or searching books.
